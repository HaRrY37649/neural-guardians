# NeuralGuard: AI-Powered Web3 Smart Contract Security Audit

## 🚀 Overview
NeuralGuard is an AI-powered **Web3 security analysis platform** designed to detect vulnerabilities in **Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and XRPL smart contracts**. By leveraging **AI-driven risk assessment** and **blockchain integration**, NeuralGuard provides deep insights into contract security, helping developers and businesses **prevent exploits** before they occur.

## 🔹 Features
- **AI-Powered Security Analysis** → Detects **reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, access control flaws, and more**.
- **Smart Contract Scanning** → Enter a **contract address** or **upload Solidity code** for review.
- **Live Blockchain Monitoring** → Tracks **newly deployed contracts** for potential risks.
- **User Dashboard** → Save past reports, compare risk scores, and download security audits.
- **Multi-Blockchain Support** → Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, XRPL.
- **API Integration** → Developers can integrate NeuralGuard’s security scanner into their **own dApps**.
- **Security Score Badge** → Projects can embed a **trust badge** showing their contract’s safety level.
- **Real-Time Notifications** → Alerts for critical vulnerabilities (email, Telegram, Slack integration).
- **Premium Features** → Subscription-based security insights for enterprises.

## 📌 How It Works
1. **Submit Smart Contract** → Enter a blockchain address or upload Solidity code.
2. **AI Analysis** → The model scans for vulnerabilities and assigns a **risk score (0-100)**.
3. **Get a Security Report** → View detected issues, suggested fixes, and download reports.
4. **Monitor in Real-Time** → Track contract safety continuously and receive alerts for threats.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- **AI Engine**: FastAPI, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Blockchain**: Web3.js, Ethers.js, Infura, XRPL.js
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), AWS Lambda/GCP (AI Model & Backend)

## ⚡ Deployment
### **Frontend (Vercel)**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/neuralguard.git
cd neuralguard
npm install
vercel deploy
```
### **Backend (AWS Lambda/GCP)**
```sh
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
serverless deploy
```

## 📖 Usage
1. **Open the website**.
2. **Enter a smart contract address or upload Solidity code**.
3. **Click 'Analyze' to run an AI-powered security audit**.
4. **View detailed security reports** and recommendations.
5. **Download and share the audit report**.
